👥 Employees are the backbone of any organization. The performance of an organization is heavily dependent on the quality and dedication of its employees. However, employee attrition poses significant challenges to organizations, including:

- 💰 **Cost Implications:** Employee attrition is expensive in terms of both time and money, as hiring and training new employees require significant resources.

- 📚 **Loss of Experience:** When experienced employees leave, organizations lose valuable knowledge and skills that are often difficult to replace.

- 📉 **Productivity Impact:** Attrition can lead to a temporary dip in productivity as new employees adjust to their roles and responsibilities.

- 💸 **Impact on Profits:** Ultimately, high attrition rates can negatively affect an organization's profitability, as it disrupts operations and increases hiring and training costs.

## 💼 Business Questions to Address

To address the employee attrition problem, it's important to consider the following business questions:

1. 🕵️‍♂️ **Contributing Factors:** What are the key factors that contribute most to employee attrition within the organization? Identifying these factors is crucial for developing effective retention strategies.

2. 🚀 **Retention Measures:** What measures can the company implement to retain employees and reduce attrition rates? Developing strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement is essential.

By addressing these questions, organizations can mitigate the challenges posed by employee attrition and create a more stable and productive work environment.
