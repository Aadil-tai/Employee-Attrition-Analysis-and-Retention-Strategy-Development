-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC In this section, we delve into the application of hypothesis testing and A/B test analytics to derive actionable insights related to employee attrition within the organization.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ### üìà Hypothesis Testing
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Hypothesis testing is a crucial statistical method used to make inferences or decisions based on data. In our analysis, we formulated hypotheses to test various factors contributing to employee attrition and employed statistical tests to validate these hypotheses.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC #### Example Hypothesis:
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in employee attrition rates between different education levels.
-- MAGIC - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in employee attrition rates between different education levels.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ##### Statistical Test Used:
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC - Chi-square test
-- MAGIC - t-test
-- MAGIC - ANOVA

-- MAGIC 1. **Impact of Job Satisfaction**: Lower job satisfaction appears to be associated with higher attrition rates. Employees who reported lower job satisfaction were more likely to leave the company compared to those with higher job satisfaction.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC 2. **Significance of Addressing Job Satisfaction**: Addressing job satisfaction levels could be crucial for retention strategies. Improving job satisfaction may help reduce attrition rates and create a more engaged and productive workforce.

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC #### Interpretation:
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC The Chi-squared test results indicate a p-value of 0.5455, which is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there's no significant difference in attrition rates between different education levels.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **Key Insights:**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC 1. **No Significant Difference in Attrition Rates**: The analysis does not provide evidence to support the notion that education levels have a significant impact on employee attrition rates within the organization.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC 2. **Consideration for Other Factors**: While education levels may not be a significant factor in attrition rates, it's essential to explore other potential factors that could influence employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and job roles.

With a very low p-value (7.15e-10), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a significant difference in monthly income between employees who left the company and those who stayed.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **Key Insights:**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC 1. **Impact of Monthly Income**: Lower monthly income appears to be associated with higher attrition rates. Employees with lower monthly income were more likely to leave the company compared to those with higher monthly income.
